    <string name="real_instructions">The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board.
        The first player is known as X and the second is O. \n \n
        Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. \n \n
        X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.</string>
